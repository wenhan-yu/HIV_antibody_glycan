# HIV_antibody_glycan

Changes in antibody glycosylation have been linked to inflammation across several diseases. Alterations in bulk antibody galactosylation can predict rheumatic flares, act as a sensor for immune-activation, predict gastric cancer relapse, track with biological age, shift with vaccination, change with HIV reservoir size on therapy, and decrease in HIV and  HCV infections. Yet, whether changes in antibody Fc-biology also track with reservoir rebound time remains unclear. However, the identification of a biomarker that could forecast viral rebound time could significantly accelerate the downselection and iterative improvement of promising HIV viral eradication strategies. Using a comprehensive antibody Fc-profiling approach, no differences were noted in total antibody glycosylation and rebound. Conversely, the level of HIV-specific antibody Fc N-galactosylation was significantly associated with time to rebound after treatment discontinuation across 3 independent cohorts. Thus virus-specific antibody glycosylation may represent a promising, simply measured, marker to track reservoir reactivation.
